Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a field of computer science that focuses on the study of organizing and manipulating data efficiently. It involves the design, analysis, and implementation of various data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (such as searching, sorting, hashing, graph traversal, etc.) to solve complex problems. DSA plays a crucial role in developing efficient and scalable software applications by providing optimized solutions for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
