**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically. Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

This repository will cover topics using **C++** and **Java**.

**Topic Wise:**

- **Sorting Algorithms**

  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Tree based DSA**

  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree

- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
